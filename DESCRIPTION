Description: This is the same share_llfs_data that I have previously been 
  distributing. However, rather than taring up the project and distributing it 
  that way, I am now going to distribute the data directory through Drive, and 
  keep code here. There is exactly nothing in the code that reveals anything 
  about the LLFS data. This simply provides a more user-friendly way of 
  documenting how this data is generated, and a formally versioned controlled 
  setting in which to keep a record of how the data is processed.
